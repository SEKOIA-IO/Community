# Configuration_Extractors

## Description
This repo contains various Python scripts for extracting malware configurations, especially made for AssemblyLine4 with their meta-service [ConfigExtractor](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/assemblyline-service-configextractor)

## Usage
Natively, this repo is used by the ASL4 configuration extraction service, but it is also possible to use these scripts through CLI or in different python scripts without AL4 using [configextractor-py](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/configextractor-py) `cx </path/to/extractor_dir> </path/to/samples>`.
